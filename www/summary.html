<h3>Overview</h3>
  <p class="lead">
    Information dissemination and online discourse on the Internet are
    subject to the algorithms and filters that operate on Internet
    infrastructure, from network firewalls to search engines. This
    course will explore the technologies that are used to control
    access to online speech and information, and cutting-edge
    technologies that can empower citizens in the face of these
    information controls. Students will learn about and experiment with
    technologies to control online discourse, ranging from firewalls
    that perform network traffic filtering to algorithms for content
    personalization and content moderation. We will also explore
    underlying technical trends, such as the increasing consolidation
    of Internet infrastructure and protocols, and the implications of
    consolidation for control over online discourse. Each course
    meeting will include a technical overview, reading discussion, and
    a hands-on laboratory activity.
