        <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p class="lead">
            Information dissemination and online discourse on the Internet are
            subject to the algorithms and filters that operate on Internet
            infrastructure, from network firewalls to search engines. This
            course will explore the technologies that are used to control
            access to online speech and information, and cutting-edge
            technologies that can empower citizens in the face of these
            information controls. Students will learn about and experiment with
            technologies to control online discourse, ranging from firewalls
            that perform network traffic filtering to algorithms for content
            personalization and content moderation. We will also explore
            underlying technical trends, such as the increasing consolidation
            of Internet infrastructure and protocols, and the implications of
            consolidation for control over online discourse. Each course
            meeting will include a technical overview, reading discussion, and
            a hands-on laboratory activity.

  <h3>Course Format</h3>

  <p>The course will meet once a week for 180-minute <b>class meetings</b>.</p>

  <p>Each class meeting will have three parts. 
  <ul>
      <li> The first part of each meeting
          will be a lecture on technical material. The presentation will be
          interactive. We will cover technical background on the topic in question.
          Format will be based on question-and-answer.</li>
      <li>The second part of each meeting will be student presentations on the
          topic of interest. </li> 
      <li>The third part of each meeting will involve a short hands-on lab activity,
          to be completed in class.</li>
  </ul> 
  </p>

<h3>Recommended Background</h3>

<p>
<b>Prerequisite:</b> Some background in computer networking, network security
and privacy, and machine learning will be helpful to understand some of the
concepts covered in the class. A prior course in computer networking is
strongly recommended.
</>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>
  Grading is based on:
  <ul>
      <li><b>Weekly Writeups (25%).</b> Each week, you should write a 500-word
          reaction piece on the topic of the assigned work. You must address
          the following in your writeup: (1) What is a summary of the reading?
          (2) What main questions did you have after reading? Writeups are due
          Friday before the topic is covered on the following Monday.
      </li>
      <li><b>Presentation (25%).</b> Each student (or group) will present to
          the class concerning the topic of the week. The presentation can be
          short, but it should be informed and teach the class something that
          is not on the syllabus. It can be a technical primer, current event
          overview, paper summary, etc. You should clear your presentation
          topic and slides draft the Friday before you are due to present.
          Group order will be signup-based, then at random among remaing topics
          and slots.
      </li>
      <li><b>Group research project (30%).</b> You should complete an
          original research project as part of the course, addressing an
          open question related to Internet censorship or online
          discourse. You should have a goal of preparing and submitting a
          paper in Spring 2020. Papers and presentations will be due the
          final day of class.
      </li>
      <li><b>Quizzes (5%).</b> At the beginning of each class, we will
          have a short in-class quiz based on the readings and
          preparation.
      </li>
      <li><b>Participation (15%).</b> Come to class prepared to discuss the
          assigned readings and any preparation as posted on the course
          website.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<h3>Late Policy</h3>


    <p>
    We understand that sometimes life events occur and that it's not
    always possible to meet every deadline. As such, we are willing to
    accept late assignments according to the following policy:

    <ul>

      <li> You start the term with a grace period "balance" of 96
      hours.</li>

      <li> Each assignment will be due at 5:00 p.m. (Chicago Local Time) on
      the due date. </li>

      <li> For each assignment, every hour late (or fraction thereof)
      that you turn in the assignment will subtract one hour from your
      grace-period balance.  For example, if you turn in your assignment
      at 6:02 p.m. on the due date, we will count this as
      two hours against your grace period.</li>

      <li> As long as your grace period balance is positive, you can
      turn in any assignment late without penalty.</li>

      <li> Once your grace period balance reaches zero, you will receive
      half credit for any assignment that you turn in, as long as you
      turn it in within one week of the due date.  If your grace period
      balance is zero and you turn in an assignment more than one week
      late, you will receive no credit for the
      assignment. <b>Important:</b> You must still turn in all
      assignments to pass the course, even if you receive zero points on
      an assignment.  Turning in all assignments is a necessary
      condition for passing. </li>

      </ul>
      Excuses with medical documentation are a legitimate exception and
      will not count against your late period.  Any other reasons for
      lateness&mdash;including but not limited to interviews, conferences,
      etc.&mdash;are <em>not</em> legitimate excuses and any resulting
      lateness will count against your grace period.

<h3>Reading and Videos</h3>

<p>
All readings will be posted on the schedule page of this webpage. Readings will
comprise popular press articles, draft book chapters from Prof. Feamster's
forthcoming book, notes, and published research papers.
