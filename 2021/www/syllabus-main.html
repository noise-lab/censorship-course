 <h3>Course Format</h3>

The course material will be delivered in two formats: (1) asyncrhonous
preparation; (2) class meetings.

 <p> <b>Preparation.</b> Preparation will entail: (1) readings; (2) a video (or
 sequence of short videos) on technical content, which will be prepared in lieu
 of a synchronous lecture.  The intention of asyncrhonous videos will be to
 reserve class meeting time for more interactive activities: discussion, data
 analysis activities, etc.  </p>
 

 <p><b> Class meetings.</b>The course will meet twice a week for 90-minute <b>class meetings</b>.</p>
  <p>Each class meeting will have <b>one of the following activities</b>.
  <ol>
      <li><b>Student presentations:</b> Summary technical presentation on the topic of class. </li> 
      <li><b>Group work:</b> A short <b>hands-on lab</b> activity.</li>
  </ol> 
  </p>

<h3>Recommended Background</h3>

<p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b> There are no required prerequisites, althoug some background in computer networking, network security
and privacy, and machine learning will be helpful to understand some of the
concepts covered in the class. 
</p>

<p>
A prior course in computer networking is
recommended for some background, but not required. Technical pre-requisites will largely be covered in class. 
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the labs will involve basic exploratory
data analysis; some experience with Python and Pandas may be useful, though it
is not required.
</p>

<h3>Grading</h3>

<p>
  Grading is based on:
  <ul>
      <li><b>Reading Responses (25%).</b> Each week, you will write a 500-word
          reaction piece on the topic of the assigned work. You must address
          the following in your writeup: 
          <ol>
              <li>What is a summary of the reading?</li>
              <li>What questions did you have after reading?</li>
          </ol>
          Writeups are due on Wednesday morning, before the topic is covered for that
          week, to allow for others to read, summarize, and comment.  (Grading is 0/1.)
      </li>
      <li><b>Presentation (25%).</b> Each student (or group) will present to
          the class concerning the topic of the week. The presentation can be
          short, but it should be informed and teach the class something that
          is not on the syllabus. It can be a technical primer, current event
          overview, paper summary, etc. You should clear your presentation
          topic and slides draft the Friday before you are due to present.
          Group order will be signup-based, then at random among remaing topics
          and slots.
      </li>
      <li><b>Group research project (35%).</b> You should complete an
          original research project as part of the course, addressing an
          open question related to Internet censorship or online
          discourse. You should have a goal of preparing and submitting a
          paper in Spring 2021. Papers and presentations will be due the
          final day of class.
      </li>
      <li><b>Participation (15%).</b> Participation has three factors:
          <ol>
              <li> Show up. Come to class prepared to discuss the
          assigned readings and any preparation as posted on the course
          website.</li> 
              <li>Participate in the in-class hands-on/lab exercises.</li>
              <li>Submit pull requests on the (in-progress) book, where
          each week corresponds to a chapter, also counts towards participation.</li>
          </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<h3>Late Policy</h3>


    <p>
    We understand that sometimes life events occur and that it's not
    always possible to meet every deadline. As such, we are willing to
    accept late assignments according to the following policy:

    <ul>

      <li> You start the term with a grace period "balance" of 96
      hours.</li>

      <li> Each assignment will be due at 5:00 p.m. (Chicago Local Time) on
      the due date. </li>

      <li> For each assignment, every hour late (or fraction thereof)
      that you turn in the assignment will subtract one hour from your
      grace-period balance.  For example, if you turn in your assignment
      at 6:02 p.m. on the due date, we will count this as
      two hours against your grace period.</li>

      <li> As long as your grace period balance is positive, you can
      turn in any assignment late without penalty.</li>

      <li> Once your grace period balance reaches zero, you will receive
      half credit for any assignment that you turn in, as long as you
      turn it in within one week of the due date.  If your grace period
      balance is zero and you turn in an assignment more than one week
      late, you will receive no credit for the
      assignment. <b>Important:</b> You must still turn in all
      assignments to pass the course, even if you receive zero points on
      an assignment.  Turning in all assignments is a necessary
      condition for passing. </li>

      </ul>
      Excuses with medical documentation are a legitimate exception and
      will not count against your late period.  Any other reasons for
      lateness&mdash;including but not limited to interviews, conferences,
      etc.&mdash;are <em>not</em> legitimate excuses and any resulting
      lateness will count against your grace period.

    </p>
<h3>Reading and Videos</h3>

<p>
All readings will be posted on the schedule page of this webpage. Readings will
comprise popular press articles, draft book chapters from Prof. Feamster's
forthcoming book, notes, and published research papers.
