# Internet Censorship and Online Speech

## Course Description 

Information dissemination and online discourse on the Internet are
subject to the algorithms and filters that operate on Internet
infrastructure, from network firewalls to search engines. This course
will explore the technologies that are used to control access to online
speech and information, and cutting-edge technologies that can empower
citizens in the face of these information controls. Students will learn
about and experiment with technologies to control online discourse,
ranging from firewalls that perform network traffic filtering to
algorithms for content personalization and content moderation. We will
also explore underlying technical trends, such as the increasing
consolidation of Internet infrastructure and protocols, and the
implications of consolidation for control over online discourse. Each
course meeting will include a technical overview, reading discussion,
and a hands-on laboratory activity.
