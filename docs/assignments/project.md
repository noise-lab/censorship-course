# Project

## Proposal

Your proposal can be a \"skeletal\" version of your final
report.  Here are some things you may wish to include.


**1. Project Title and Team**

-   **Provide a title for your project**
-   List all members of your team (full names and CNET IDs). The ideal
    number of group members is 2-3; please reach out to the staff if you
    need an exception on this and justify it in your proposal. In the
    above template, you can drop this in simply as the author list.

**2. Project Summary**

-   Think of this as a draft of your project report introduction.
    Advice on [writing a good
    introduction](http://www-net.cs.umass.edu/kurose/writing/intro-style.html)
-   What is the problem?
-   Why is it an important problem? (Provide citations if possible to
    support your claims of relevance. Examples could be previous
    work/research papers, news stories, anecdotes, software packages,
    etc.)
-   What kinds of actions could be taken based on your results, and who
    is equipped to take those actions? 

**3. Related Work**

-   Draft as much as you can of your related work section.
-   Organize your related work so it is more than just a "list". 
    Organize thematically; look at related work sections from other
    published papers for examples.
-   Include all references (e.g., as bibtex) so your related work is as
    complete as possible for now.
-   Also articulate *how your work extends* the related work you cite.

**4. Project Preparation and Prerequisites**

-   What do you need to complete this project?
-   If your project is measurement based, describe the data you have and
    the data you'll need to collect, as well as results you might expect
    and how you would present them
-   If your project is to build a system (e.g., censorship circumvention
    tool), describe how you may go about doing that (will you extend an
    existing software code base, for example)?

**5. Evaluation**

-   This of this as a starting point for the project.
-   Describe your evaluation process? Be as specific as possible about
    your evaluation techniques 

**6. Ethics**

-   Briefly discuss the ethical implications of your work. Will your
    models suffer from any kind of bias? Will this potential bias impact
    the fairness of any proposed solutions?

## Final Deliverable 

Your final project deliverable should be:

-   **A brief (4-6 page is plenty) writeup of your project.** building
    on your proposal/interim report in the ACM paper format we discussed
    in earlier assignments (you should have a nice head start on
    this!).  There is no page limit (or minimum) for this writeup.  It
    can be **\"as long as it needs to be\"**.  If you did some data
    analysis, the writeup should obviously make it clear exactly how you
    collected, processed, and analyzed the data to a level that a reader
    should understand what you did, and so forth.  
-   **A brief video summarizing your project and main findings.** This
    can be (and should be!) short!  Examples from past years are online
    as a playlist.  I intend to use these to (1) Put them into a
    playlist and host a watch party (if/when there is interest); (2)
    showcase the class; (3) show them as examples in future years.

(if you must) as a paper skeleton for
your report.
