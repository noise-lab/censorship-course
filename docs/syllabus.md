## Course Format

The course material will be delivered in two formats: (1) asynchronous
preparation; (2) class meetings.

**Preparation.** Preparation will entail: (1) readings; (2) a [video (or
sequence of short
videos)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpherdrLyny9vAH3GUofYRu4Ig8wY9Lho)
on technical content, which will be prepared in lieu of a synchronous
lecture. The intention of asynchronous videos will be to reserve class
meeting time for more interactive activities: discussion, data analysis
activities, etc.

**Class meetings.**The course will meet twice a week for 90-minute
**class meetings**.

Each class meeting will have **one of the following activities**.

1.  **Student presentations:** Summary technical presentation on the
    topic of class.
2.  **Group work:** A short **hands-on lab** activity.

## Recommended Background

**Prerequisites:** There are no required prerequisites, although some
background in computer networking, network security and privacy, and
machine learning will be helpful to understand some of the concepts
covered in the class.

A prior course in computer networking is recommended for some
background, but not required. Technical pre-requisites will largely be
covered in class.

Additionally, the labs will involve basic exploratory data analysis;
some experience with Python and Pandas may be useful, though it is not
required.

## Grading

Grading is based on:

- **Reading Responses (25%).** Each week, you will write a 500-word
  reaction piece on the topic of the assigned work. You must address the
  following in your writeup:
  1.  What is a summary of the reading?
  2.  What questions did you have after reading?

  Writeups are due on Wednesday morning, before the topic is covered for
  that week, to allow for others to read, summarize, and comment.
  (Grading is 0/1.)
- **Presentation (25%).** Each student (or group) will present to the
  class concerning the topic of the week. The presentation can be short,
  but it should be informed and teach the class something that is not on
  the syllabus. It can be a technical primer, current event overview,
  paper summary, etc. You should clear your presentation topic and
  slides draft the Friday before you are due to present. Group order
  will be signup-based, then at random among remaining topics and slots.
- **Group research project (35%).** You should complete an original
  research project as part of the course, addressing an open question
  related to Internet censorship or online discourse. You should have a
  goal of eventually preparing and submitting a research paper. Papers and
  presentations will be due the final day of class. More details on the
  project can be found [here](assignments/project.md).
- **Participation (15%).** Participation has three factors:
  1.  Show up. Come to class prepared to discuss the assigned readings
      and any preparation as posted on the course website.
  2.  Participate in the in-class hands-on/lab exercises.
  3.  Submit pull requests on the (in-progress) book, where each week
      corresponds to a chapter, also counts towards participation.

## Late Policy

We understand that sometimes life events occur and that it's not always
possible to meet every deadline. As such, we are willing to accept late
assignments according to the following policy:

- You start the term with a grace period "balance" of 96 hours.
- Each assignment will be due at 5:00 p.m. (Chicago Local Time) on the
  due date.
- For each assignment, every hour late (or fraction thereof) that you
  turn in the assignment will subtract one hour from your grace-period
  balance. For example, if you turn in your assignment at 6:02 p.m. on
  the due date, we will count this as two hours against your grace
  period.
- As long as your grace period balance is positive, you can turn in any
  assignment late without penalty.
- Once your grace period balance reaches zero, you will receive half
  credit for any assignment that you turn in, as long as you turn it in
  within one week of the due date. If your grace period balance is zero
  and you turn in an assignment more than one week late, you will
  receive no credit for the assignment. **Important:** You must still
  turn in all assignments to pass the course, even if you receive zero
  points on an assignment. Turning in all assignments is a necessary
  condition for passing.

Excuses with medical documentation are a legitimate exception and will
not count against your late period. Any other reasons for
lateness—including but not limited to interviews, conferences, etc.—are
*not* legitimate excuses and any resulting lateness will count against
your grace period.

## Reading and Videos

All readings will be posted on the schedule page of this webpage.
Readings will comprise popular press articles, draft book chapters from
Prof. Feamster's forthcoming book, notes, and published research papers.

## Academic Honesty and Integrity

You are taking this class to learn. My goal is to teach you new concepts---any
attempts to circumvent that deprive you of the process of learning.  To that
end, you are responsible for doing your own work in this class. 

You may talk to the course staff and to other students (past and present)
about any assignments in this class. You can work together in discussing
**how** you approached a particular problem, as long as you acknowledge who
you worked with. 

"Modern" coding indeed involves a lot of copy/paste/adaptation of existing
code blocks, and such adaptation is permissible, within reason. If you find
approaches and solutions on the Internet to various problems in this class,
you are welcome to borrow ideas and approaches (and even copy code snippets,
with acknowledgment and links). **Please acknowledge all collaborators and
sources.** 

The primary activity that is not permitted it copying a solution
verbatim; if you find yourself running code that has been copy/pasted from
anywhere, pause and think. Ask the staff if you have questions about this
policy.

The University of Chicago has formal policies related to academic honesty and
plagiarism. We abide by these standards in this course. Depending on the
severity of the offense, you risk being dismissed altogether from the course.

No collaboration is permitted on quizzes or exams. All work submitted for the
project must properly cite ideas and work that are not those of the students
in the group.

## Kindness, Respect, and Free Expression

Topics in this course, particularly those that touch on ethics, policy, the
law, and society,  may touch on topics that challenge your existing thinking,
and certain discussions may make you feel uncomfortable or challenged. 

To this end, we seek to make this class an inclusive environment, one of
mutual respect for others. The University of Chicago is committed to the
principles of free expression, and part of my duty as your instructor is to
help foster that environment. 

To achieve the vibrant intellectual atmosphere we aim for, an environment of
respect for each other is of utmost importance. Every person should conduct
themselves with integrity, compassion, and thoughtfulness so everyone feels
comfortable participating and benefits from a collective learning experience.

Think not only of what you say but *how* you say it.  

Participation and speaking up is critical to the vibrant intellectual
environment we all want to create among ourselves. I may not always be clear
in my own presentation (and I also make plenty of mistakes), but I will not
know that unless you speak up. If you have a question, there's a good chance
half of the class is probably thinking the same thing. Be bold.  

Finally, think about when to step back, so that everyone can have a chance to
speak.  To that end, I typically make a concerted effort to step back from
discussions myself---viewing my role as more of a facilitator---so that you
can feel free to speak. If I announce (or allude to) my opinion on a matter in
front of the class, that may make some of you less eager to share your own
viewpoints, which is also a fail.
