## Course Format

The course material will be delivered in two formats: (1) asynchronous
preparation; (2) class meetings.

**Preparation.** Preparation will entail: (1) readings; (2) a [video (or
sequence of short
videos)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpherdrLyny9vAH3GUofYRu4Ig8wY9Lho)
on technical content, which will be prepared in lieu of a synchronous
lecture. The intention of asynchronous videos will be to reserve class
meeting time for more interactive activities: discussion, data analysis
activities, etc.

**Class meetings.**The course will meet twice a week for 90-minute
**class meetings**.

Each class meeting will have **one of the following activities**.

1.  **Student presentations:** Summary technical presentation on the
    topic of class.
2.  **Group work:** A short **hands-on lab** activity.

## Recommended Background

**Prerequisites:** There are no required prerequisites, although some
background in computer networking, network security and privacy, and
machine learning will be helpful to understand some of the concepts
covered in the class.

A prior course in computer networking is recommended for some
background, but not required. Technical pre-requisites will largely be
covered in class.

Additionally, the labs will involve basic exploratory data analysis;
some experience with Python and Pandas may be useful, though it is not
required.

## Grading

Grading is based on:

- **Reading Responses (25%).** Each week, you will write a 500-word
  reaction piece on the topic of the assigned work. You must address the
  following in your writeup:
  1.  What is a summary of the reading?
  2.  What questions did you have after reading?

  Writeups are due on Wednesday morning, before the topic is covered for
  that week, to allow for others to read, summarize, and comment.
  (Grading is 0/1.)
- **Presentation (25%).** Each student (or group) will present to the
  class concerning the topic of the week. The presentation can be short,
  but it should be informed and teach the class something that is not on
  the syllabus. It can be a technical primer, current event overview,
  paper summary, etc. You should clear your presentation topic and
  slides draft the Friday before you are due to present. Group order
  will be signup-based, then at random among remaining topics and slots.
- **Group research project (35%).** You should complete an original
  research project as part of the course, addressing an open question
  related to Internet censorship or online discourse. You should have a
  goal of preparing and submitting a paper in Spring 2022. Papers and
  presentations will be due the final day of class.
- **Participation (15%).** Participation has three factors:
  1.  Show up. Come to class prepared to discuss the assigned readings
      and any preparation as posted on the course website.
  2.  Participate in the in-class hands-on/lab exercises.
  3.  Submit pull requests on the (in-progress) book, where each week
      corresponds to a chapter, also counts towards participation.

## Late Policy

We understand that sometimes life events occur and that it's not always
possible to meet every deadline. As such, we are willing to accept late
assignments according to the following policy:

- You start the term with a grace period "balance" of 96 hours.
- Each assignment will be due at 5:00 p.m. (Chicago Local Time) on the
  due date.
- For each assignment, every hour late (or fraction thereof) that you
  turn in the assignment will subtract one hour from your grace-period
  balance. For example, if you turn in your assignment at 6:02 p.m. on
  the due date, we will count this as two hours against your grace
  period.
- As long as your grace period balance is positive, you can turn in any
  assignment late without penalty.
- Once your grace period balance reaches zero, you will receive half
  credit for any assignment that you turn in, as long as you turn it in
  within one week of the due date. If your grace period balance is zero
  and you turn in an assignment more than one week late, you will
  receive no credit for the assignment. **Important:** You must still
  turn in all assignments to pass the course, even if you receive zero
  points on an assignment. Turning in all assignments is a necessary
  condition for passing.

Excuses with medical documentation are a legitimate exception and will
not count against your late period. Any other reasons for
lateness—including but not limited to interviews, conferences, etc.—are
*not* legitimate excuses and any resulting lateness will count against
your grace period.

## Reading and Videos

All readings will be posted on the schedule page of this webpage.
Readings will comprise popular press articles, draft book chapters from
Prof. Feamster's forthcoming book, notes, and published research papers.
