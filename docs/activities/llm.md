# **Exploring Censorship in AI-Generated Content**

## **Background**  

AI systems like large language models (LLMs) are designed to provide helpful
responses to a wide range of queries. However, these systems also include
mechanisms to filter or censor responses to certain prompts. This censorship
is intended to prevent harmful, offensive, or unethical outputs. While these
safeguards are important, they raise questions about how such decisions are
made, who decides what is censored, and the potential implications for free
expression. 

In this assignment, you will explore how LLMs handle potentially sensitive
prompts, identify patterns in their responses, and critically reflect on the
ethical and practical challenges of censorship in AI.

## **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this activity, you will:
1. Understand how LLMs implement censorship or filtering of responses.
2. Identify and analyze patterns in the topics or language that trigger
   censorship.
3. Reflect on the ethical, social, and technical challenges of censorship
   in AI systems.
4. Discuss the implications of AI censorship for free expression and
   accountability.

## **Instructions**

### **Step 1: Experiment with Prompts**
1. In your group, brainstorm a list of prompts to test on an LLM. Your prompts
   should fall into the following categories:
- **Controversial political topics** (e.g., opinions on policy or global
events).
- **Ethical dilemmas** (e.g., scenarios involving moral conflict).
- **Misinformation or conspiracy theories** (e.g., questions
about debunked claims).
- **Sensitive societal issues** (e.g., discussions of
discrimination or inequality).
- **Non-controversial queries** (e.g., trivia, factual
information).

2. Test each prompt using the LLM provided.
Document:
- The input prompt.
- The LLM's response.
- Whether the response was filtered, generalized, or flagged as inappropriate.

### **Step 2: Analyze Patterns**

Discuss:
- What types of prompts were censored or filtered?
- Did the LLM explain why it chose not to respond or provided a filtered
  response?
  - Were there any unexpected results, such as over-censorship or inconsistent
    handling of prompts?

## **Discussion**

After completing the activity, we will hold a class discussion to share your
findings and reflections. Be prepared to discuss:
- Examples of prompts and responses you found most interesting or surprising.
- How the LLM's censorship aligns (or conflicts) with free expression
  principles.
- Your thoughts on how transparency and accountability in AI censorship can
  be improved.
