# Transparency Reports

Transparency reports are documents that provide information about the
activities of a company or organization, typically focused on the following
types of activities:
* Data collection (e.g., what data a company collects about its users)
* Takedown requests (e.g., what requests the company has received to remove
  content or postings from its website)

These reports can typically include information about the organization's
finances, operations, and compliance with laws and regulations. They may also
include information about the organization's policies and procedures, as well
as its commitment to ethical and responsible business practices. Transparency
reports are often used by companies to demonstrate their commitment to
transparency and accountability.

However, these reports are also typically based on companies' self-reporting
practices and thus may not be complete or accurate. For example, companies may
withhold various details about the specific content that was removed, who asked
for the content to be removed, the legal basis for the removal, and so forth.

## Background

In this activity, you will investigate the transparency
reports of a number of companies and organizations to determine what the
reveal, and what information you'd perhaps like to know more about but the
reports do not disclose.

## Part 1.1: Transparency Reports

Read the transparency reports for two of the following companies, and (if you
have time), find one more that is not listed:

* [Google](https://transparencyreport.google.com/)
* [Twitter](https://transparency.twitter.com/)
* [YouTube](https://transparencyreport.google.com/youtube-policy/removals)
* [Facebook](https://transparency.fb.com/)
* [Twitch](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Transparency-Reports?language=en_US)
* [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/en-us/)

While these transparency reports focus on a wide variety of activities, in
this class we are primarily focused on activities that relate to speech (e.g.,
takedown notices, removal of content, censorship, etc.). Try to focus your
attention on those portions of the reports. We have linked a few of these
sections above specifically for your convenience.

## Part 1.2: The EU Digital Services Act (DSA)

The European Union has recently passed a new regulation called the Digital
Services Act (DSA). This regulation requires large online platforms to publish
transparency reports that provide detailed information about their content
moderation practices. In this related part of the activity, you will explore
some of the information that platforms do (and do not) make available as part
of their obligations under the DSA.

The Digital Services Act (DSA) is a landmark European regulation that became
effective in February 2024, with some obligations applied to Very Large Online
Platforms (VLOPs) and Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs) starting in
August 2023. It aims to make the digital world safer by ensuring that what is
illegal offline is also illegal online, holding intermediaries accountable.
The DSA imposes various transparency and content moderation requirements,
especially on VLOPs, which are platforms with over 45 million monthly users in
the EU.

One of the key obligations under the DSA is for VLOPs to publish a
Transparency Database where they must provide public access to their content
moderation decisions, known as "Statements of Reasons" (SoRs). These
statements must include detailed information on the decision-making process,
including whether it was automated and on what legal grounds, as well as
pathways for appeal. Furthermore, the DSA allows vetted researchers to access
platform data to study systemic risks, such as online gender-based violence.

## Part 2: Reflection

Think about the following questions:

* What information does the report provide?
* What information is missing?
* What information would you like to know more about?
* Who are the intended audience(s) for the report?
