# Transparency Reports

Transparency reports are documents that provide information about the
activities of a company or organization, typically focused on the following
types of activities:
* Data collection (e.g., what data a company collects about its users)
* Takedown requests (e.g., what requests the company has received to remove
  content or postings from its website)

These reports can typically include information about the organization's
finances, operations, and compliance with laws and regulations. They may also
include information about the organization's policies and procedures, as well
as its commitment to ethical and responsible business practices. Transparency
reports are often used by companies to demonstrate their commitment to
transparency and accountability.

However, these reports are also typically based on companies' self-reporting
practices and thus may not be complete or accurate. For example, companies may
withhold various details about the specific content that was removed, who asked
for the content to be removed, the legal basis for the removal, and so forth.

## Background

In this activity, you will investigate the transparency
reports of a number of companies and organizations to determine what the
reveal, and what information you'd perhaps like to know more about but the
reports do not disclose.

## Part 1: Transparency Reports

Read the transparency reports for two of the following companies, and (if you
have time), find one more that is not listed:

* [Google](https://transparencyreport.google.com/)
* [Twitter](https://transparency.twitter.com/)
* [YouTube](https://transparencyreport.google.com/youtube-policy/removals)
* [Facebook](https://transparency.fb.com/)
* [Twitch](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Transparency-Reports?language=en_US)
* [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/transparency/en-us/)

While these transparency reports focus on a wide variety of activities, in
this class we are primarily focused on activities that relate to speech (e.g.,
takedown notices, removal of content, censorship, etc.). Try to focus your
attention on those portions of the reports. We have linked a few of these
sections above specifically for your convenience.

## Part 2: Reflection

Think about the following questions:

* What information does the report provide?
* What information is missing?
* What information would you like to know more about?
* Who are the intended audience(s) for the report?
