# Content Moderation

In this exercise, you will explore the extent to which different platforms
specify content moderation policies. We will explore platforms in several
categories: posting forums, social media, and web hosting.

## Background: Content Moderation


Content moderation is the process of monitoring user-generated content (UGC)
on websites, social media, and other online platforms to ensure it meets
certain standards of quality and appropriateness.  Content moderation involves
reviewing and removing content that violates a platformâ€™s terms of service.
Each platform independently sets these terms of service and determines what
content is acceptable. 

Content moderators review, approve, or reject UGC based on predetermined
criteria, such as obscenity, hate speech, and copyright infringement. Content
moderation is an important part of maintaining a safe and secure online
environment.

## Part 1: Investigation of Content Moderation Policies

Investigate the content moderation policies of the following types of
platforms:

* Posting forums (Reddit)
* Social media (Facebook, Twitter)
* Web hosting (WordPress)
* Video hosting (YouTube, TikTok)
* Content delivery (Cloudflare, AWS)
* Merchandise (Etsy)

Try to find information about the content moderation policies for one site
from each category. In particular, explore content delivery and web hosting, a
a category of platforms for which content moderation is not often discussed.

## Part 2: Discussion

Consider some of the following aspects of each content moderation:

* How explicit is the content moderation policy about the types of content
  that are covered?
* Are users notified if they are in violation of the policy? What would be the
  advantages and disadvantages of notifying users of such violations?
* Are different categories of content handled differently? For example, there
  are substantial laws against posting copyrighted content. Disinformation is
  less regulated. How do these policies reflect the legal landscape?
* How do you think these policies are enforced, at large and small companies?
  What is the role of a human vs. algorithm?
