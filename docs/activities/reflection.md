## Background

DNS reflection and amplification attacks are a type of Distributed Denial of
Service (DDoS) attack that leverage the DNS protocol to overwhelm a victim's
network with a large volume of traffic. In this assignment, you will simulate
the behavior of a DNS reflection and amplification attack to understand how it
works and its impact on a network.

## Assignment

### Part 1: Setting up the virtual network environment

1. Install a network simulator or a virtual machine (VM) software on your
   computer.
2. Create a virtual network environment that includes a DNS server, a victim's
   machine, and an attacker's machine.
3. Configure the network settings for each machine, including IP addresses and
   DNS server settings.

### Part 2: Simulating a DNS reflection and amplification attack

1. Install Scapy or Hping3 on the attacker's machine.
2. Use Scapy or Hping3 to generate DNS queries with a spoofed source IP
   address to the DNS server.
3. Observe how the DNS server responds with large DNS responses that are sent
   to the victim's machine.
4. Measure the volume of traffic generated by the attack and the impact it has
   on the victim's machine.

### Part 3: Mitigating the attack

1. Implement best practices for securing DNS servers, such as using firewalls
   to block traffic from unknown sources, limiting recursive queries, and
   enabling DNS response rate limiting.
2. Configure the firewall on the victim's machine to block traffic from the
   attacker's IP address.
3. Re-run the attack and observe how the mitigation measures affect the impact
   of the attack.

## Thought Questions

1. What is the impact of a DNS reflection and amplification attack on a
   victim's network? How can it affect the availability and performance of
network services?
2. What are some best practices for securing DNS servers and preventing DNS
   reflection and amplification attacks?
3. What are some ethical considerations involved in simulating an attack in a
   controlled environment? How can we ensure that this activity is conducted
   in a responsible and ethical manner?
