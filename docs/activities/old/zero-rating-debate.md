# Zero Rating

In this activity, we will engage in a debate about the advantages and
disadvantages of zero-rating.

## Background

Zero rating is a practice in which Internet service providers (ISPs) exempt
certain applications or services from customers' data usage limits,
effectively making them free to use. Proponents of zero rating argue that it
can increase access to information and services for low-income individuals,
while opponents argue that it creates an uneven playing field by giving
preferential treatment to some services over others.

## Debate Format

**Resolution**. Resolved: Zero rating is a harmful practice that undermines
fair competition on the internet.

1. **Debate Teams**. Divide into two teams: the affirmative
   team (in favor of the resolution) and the negative team (opposing the
   resolution). Each team should have equal numbers of members.

2. **Opening Statements**. Each team should present an opening statement of up
   to five minutes, during which they will introduce their arguments and
   provide an overview of their position.

3. **Cross-Examination**. After the opening statements, each team should
   cross-examine the opposing team's opening statements. This will involve
   asking questions and challenging the opposing team's arguments.

4. **Main Arguments**. Each team should present their main arguments in
   support of or against the resolution. The affirmative team should argue
   that zero rating harms consumers and innovation by allowing ISPs to pick
   winners and losers in the marketplace, while the negative team should argue
   that zero rating benefits consumers and innovation by increasing access to
   information and services for low-income individuals.

5. **Rebuttal**. After the main arguments have been presented, each team
   should rebut the opposing team's arguments. This will involve challenging
   the opposing team's claims and providing counterarguments.

6. **Closing Statements**. Finally, each team should present a closing
   statement of up to two minutes, during which they will summarize their
   position and reiterate their main arguments.

## Class Discussion

* What are the trade-offs between zero rating and fair competition? 
* Can zero rating be implemented in a way that benefits consumers without
  harming fair competition? 
* How can policymakers address the challenges posed by zero rating?
