# Activity: Prioritizing Video Traffic over Web Traffic

## Objectives

- Understand the concept of traffic prioritization and its impact on network
  performance
- Explore the challenges and trade-offs involved in prioritizing traffic

## Materials

- Network simulator tool or platform (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, or
  OpenNet)
- Laptop

## Instructions

1. Divide into groups of 3-4 and assign each group a network simulator tool or
   platform.

2. Discuss the concept of traffic prioritization and how ISPs might prioritize
   certain types of traffic over others to manage network congestion.

3. Explain that in this activity, you will play the role of an ISP and
   prioritize video traffic over web traffic.

4. Open your network simulator tool or platform and create a network topology
   that includes multiple devices such as PCs, servers, routers, and switches.

5. Set up a web server and a video streaming server on separate devices in
   your network.

6. Configure your network to prioritize video traffic over web traffic. You
   can use various techniques such as quality of service (QoS) policies,
   traffic shaping, or bandwidth allocation.

7. Test your network by having some devices access the web server and others
   access the video streaming server. Observe how your network performs under
   different traffic conditions and measure the impact of your traffic
   prioritization rules on network performance.

## Discussion

Discuss the trade-offs involved in prioritizing video traffic over web
traffic. For example, how does prioritizing video traffic affect the
performance of other applications? How does it impact net neutrality
principles?
