# Denial of Service Attacks

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a type of cyber attack that involves
sending large amounts of traffic to a server or network in order to overwhelm
it and cause it to crash or become unavailable. The traffic is usually
generated from multiple sources, making it difficult to trace and block. DDoS
attacks can be used to target websites, networks, or even individual
computers.

## Background: Project Galileo

Project Galileo, founded in 2014, is a program by Cloudflare that aims to
protect vulnerable organizations such as artistic groups, humanitarian
organizations, and political dissidents from cyber attacks through free and
robust security services. These organizations often have limited budgets and
are targeted by powerful opponents, but Project Galileo offers its services to
them through trusted partners, without implying endorsement from all partner
organizations. The goal is to ensure that the internet can continue to be used
as a tool for spreading and expanding ideas, without being hindered by
malicious traffic.

## Part 1: Investigate Project Galileo

1. Visit the Project Galileo website and read the information about the
   program. 
2. What is the goal of Project Galileo?
3. What are the types of services that Project Galileo offers?
4. Who are the partners of Project Galileo?


## Part 2: Discussion

1. What are some of the reasons that an organization might be targeted by a
   DoS attack?
2. Imagine yourself as an adminsitrator for Project Galileo. How do you decide
   who to offer the service to? Should it be based on anyone who needs it?
   Should it be based on content, merit, or type of speech? Should it only be
   for services currently under attack, or is a proactive approach
   appropriate? 
   decide which "tier" of service to offer to an applicant?
