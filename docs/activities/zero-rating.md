# Zero Rating

## Learning Objective

Understand how zero-rating policies influence user behavior and network access by measuring app data usage, comparing zero-rated and non-zero-rated services, and investigating ISP partnerships.

## Part 1: Experience with Zero Rating

### Install a Data Monitoring Tool

- Install a mobile data usage tracker on your phone:
  - Android: Use [GlassWire](https://www.glasswire.com/) or a similar app.
  - iOS: Use the built-in cellular data usage view in Settings.

- Reset the data counter or ensure you are starting with a clean measurement session.

### Select and Use Two Applications

- Choose one app that is commonly zero-rated by ISPs (e.g., Facebook, WhatsApp, Spotify).
- Choose another app that is not commonly zero-rated (e.g., Signal, Mastodon, or a smaller news site).
- Use each app for 5â€“10 minutes under similar conditions:
  - For example, send messages, browse feeds, or stream short videos.
- Record how much data each app uses during this time.

### Research ISP Partnerships

- Look up whether major ISPs (in the U.S. or globally) have offered zero-rating for either of the apps you tested.
- Use news articles, FCC filings, or ISP websites to verify whether these apps have been part of a zero-rating plan.
  - Examples: Facebook Free Basics, T-Mobile Binge On, Reliance Jio bundles.

### Analyze and Compare

- Compare the amount of data consumed by the two apps.
- Consider how zero-rating affects user incentives and the visibility of data costs.
- Reflect on the potential impacts on app competition and user access.

## Part 2: Discussion

Answer the following questions based on your experiment:

1. How did data usage compare between the zero-rated and non-zero-rated apps?
2. If one of the apps had been zero-rated, how would that have changed your perception or usage of it?
3. How might zero-rating policies affect smaller apps or platforms trying to compete?
4. Are there technical or policy-based ways to support low-income users without compromising competition?
5. Based on your data and research, is zero-rating more beneficial or harmful in practice?
